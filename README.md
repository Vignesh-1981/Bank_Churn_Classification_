# Bank_Churn_Classification_
This Jupyter notebook tackles bank churn prediction. It leverages pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data handling, preprocessing (One-Hot Encoding, StandardScaler), and model building. It specifically trains and evaluates Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVC) models using a pipeline for efficiency.
